For reference, we are trying to replicate the project eurisclo, a sibling project, which has units.lisp, eurisclo.lisp and heuristics.lisp in its src directory. This is based on EUR, unearthed Eurisko code by Doug Lenat, also in the src of eurisclo.

The current goal is at the interplay of heuristics, task manager and main.
We expect the cycle in main, as new units and tasks are created.
Why is this not happening?
Do NOT enable eternal mode, this runs forever so you won't get any output from that, and it's not currently interesting.

Some possible next steps:
- extract a principled design pattern from the experiment with the enabled heuristics h4, h5, h6 working in concert
- then look at the original heuristics.lisp from eurisclo and faithfully re-implement h4, h5, h6 to be fully-fledged
- have a better logging infrastructure, that allows focusing depending on debugging task
- have an eternal mode that also supports fixed iterations for testing in the sandbox
