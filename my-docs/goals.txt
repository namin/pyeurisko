For reference, we are trying to replicate the project eurisclo, a sibling project, which has units.lisp, eurisclo.lisp and heuristics.lisp in its src directory. This is based on EUR, unearthed Eurisko code by Doug Lenat, also in the src of eurisclo.

We should start by debugging h5, and get it to interact with h6.

Ignore *~ files. They are emacs backup files.

The important files are shown in tree.txt in this directory.
