For reference, we are trying to replicate the project eurisclo, a sibling project, which has units.lisp, eurisclo.lisp and heuristics.lisp in its src directory. This is based on EUR, unearthed Eurisko code by Doug Lenat, also in the src of eurisclo.

The current goal is at the interplay of heuristics, task manager and main.
We expect the cycle in main, as new units and tasks are created.
Why is this not happening?
Do NOT enable eternal mode, this runs forever so you won't get any output from that, and it's not currently interesting.

Next steps (in some order):
- provide stats at the end of run of newly created units, and debug if it's 0 or low.
- pick a heuristic to port and enable. Look at claude-docs/PORTING_HEURISTICS.md. Remember to be faithful to the original heuristics in the sibling project eurisclo/src/heuristics.lisp.

Ignore *~ files. They are emacs backup files.

The important files are shown in tree.txt in this directory.
