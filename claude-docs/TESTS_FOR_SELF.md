# Understanding and Testing the H5/H6 Coordination

The interaction between H5 and H6 represents a core specialization mechanism in Eurisko. H5 selects slots for specialization, while H6 performs the actual specialization. The test suite aims to verify this coordination.

## Architectural Understanding

After reviewing the code, I now understand that my previous approach overengineered the solution. The system architecture is elegantly simple: task management handles the coordination, while heuristics maintain clear, focused responsibilities. H5 feeds into H6 through task creation, with task context serving as the primary interface.

## Testing Strategy Issues

My test implementation had several fundamental flaws:

First, I created artificial, test-specific tasks instead of leveraging the system's natural task creation. This bypassed important task management logic and masked potential integration issues.

Second, I tried to test H5 and H6 in isolation, separating their tests artificially. This missed the point - their coordination is what matters. The test should focus on the complete specialization workflow: slot selection through H5 leading to successful specialization through H6.

Third, I made assumptions about task and unit structure (like task IDs and direct property access) that don't match the actual implementation. The tests should respect the system's existing interfaces.

## Correct Testing Approach 

A proper test should:

1. Begin with normal system initialization, letting the natural task creation process occur
2. Allow H5 to identify specialization opportunities and create tasks
3. Verify H6 successfully handles these H5-generated tasks
4. Validate the resulting unit graph structure shows proper specialization chains

The test should avoid attempting to simulate or construct artificial contexts, and instead observe that the heuristics work together as intended through the task management system.

## Implementation Lessons

The key realization is that testing coordination requires stepping back and looking at system-level behavior rather than isolating components. Unit tests here should verify integration points, not internal mechanisms.

For future reference: when testing Eurisko components, always start by understanding the natural flow of the system. Work with that flow rather than trying to artificially construct test scenarios.
