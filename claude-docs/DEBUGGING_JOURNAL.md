## January 26, 2025 - Debugging Heuristics Stats and H5 Execution

Today I worked on debugging why H5 wasn't executing properly and why heuristic statistics weren't being tracked correctly. Here are the key findings and changes made:

### Initial Problems Identified
1. Heuristic statistics were showing all heuristics with 0% success rates
2. Tasks were completing but H5 wasn't appearing to execute
3. Debug logs weren't providing enough visibility into the system's operation

### Key Changes Made

#### Rule Factory Redesign
The original rule factory implementation was overly complex and caused execution issues. I simplified it from:

```python
def rule_factory(func: Callable) -> Callable:
    def make_factory(heuristic):
        def factory():
            def wrapper(context):
                return func(heuristic, context)
            return wrapper
        return factory
    return make_factory
```

to:

```python
def rule_factory(func: Callable) -> Callable:
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(rule, context):
        return func(rule, context)
    return wrapper
```

This change eliminated the tuple calling errors and simplified the execution path.

#### Record Function Improvements
I fixed the heuristic record tracking by making record functions accept both rule and context parameters:

```python
def record_func(rule, context):
    return True
```

This aligned with how the rule factory expected functions to behave.

#### Debug Logging Enhancement
Added debug logging throughout the system to track:
- Task execution and properties
- Heuristic discovery and initialization
- Unit category membership
- Rule execution attempts

### Current Status
- H1 and H6 are now executing successfully (100% success rate)
- H5 is being properly initialized but still not executing successfully
- We have better visibility into the task processing pipeline

### Next Steps
1. Add more debug logging to track H5 rule execution
2. Investigate why H5's valid slots selection isn't working
3. Consider revising H5's slot selection logic to work with actual unit properties
4. Add unit tests for the rule factory and heuristic execution

### Lessons Learned
1. The importance of consistent function signatures across the system
2. The value of comprehensive debug logging during complex execution flows
3. The need to match heuristic property access with actual unit structure
4. The benefit of simplifying complex factory patterns when possible

### Code Quality Improvements Needed
1. Better documentation of expected function signatures
2. More consistent error handling across heuristics
3. Clearer separation between rule execution and record keeping
4. Better unit test coverage for core execution paths

I'll continue updating this journal as we make further improvements to the system.
