## 2024-01-26: Investigating Why Main Cycle Ends Quickly

Issues found:
1. System object not properly propagated to heuristics
2. Task structure mismatch - h1 expects old task format while code uses new Task dataclass
3. Success/failure tracking is misleading - marks tasks as successful even when heuristic is not relevant

Changes made:
1. Added System to TaskManager
2. Modified h1 to use new Task format and Task dataclass
3. Added debug logging to track h1 execution

Next steps:
1. Fix h1 task creation and relevance checks
2. Add Task import to h1.py
3. Consider revising success tracking to separate relevance from execution success
