# Neo-Eurisko: Research Directions and Speculations

## Core Research Question
How can we build systems that genuinely discover and compose new concepts, leveraging both symbolic reasoning and modern AI capabilities?

## Promising Directions

### 1. LLM-Guided Concept Formation

#### Current Limitation
Currently, LLMs suggest modifications to existing heuristics but don't participate in concept formation itself. The system discovers patterns but doesn't really form new conceptual categories.

#### Research Opportunity
Use LLMs to help form genuinely new concepts by:

```python
# Example concept formation process
new_concept = {
    "name": "oscillating_sequence",
    "definition": "A sequence that alternates between increasing and decreasing",
    "detection_rules": [
        "Check local maxima and minima",
        "Verify alternation pattern"
    ],
    "examples": [1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 5],
    "relationships": {
        "similar_to": ["periodic_sequence", "wave_pattern"],
        "differs_from": ["monotonic_sequence"]
    }
}
```

Key research questions:
1. How do we verify that a proposed concept is genuinely new?
2. How do we measure concept quality?
3. How do we compose concepts to form more complex ones?

### 2. Multi-Modal Pattern Discovery

Current Neo-Eurisko only works with numerical patterns. But what if we could discover patterns across:
- Code structure
- Natural language descriptions
- Visual representations
- Behavioral patterns

Example:
```python
class MultiModalPattern:
    """Pattern that exists across multiple representations"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.manifestations = {
            'numerical': '[1,2,4,8,16] - exponential growth',
            'visual': 'Geometric spacing in log plot',
            'code': 'Repeated multiplication by constant',
            'behavioral': 'Resource usage grows exponentially'
        }
        self.unifying_concept = "Exponential behavior"
```

Research challenges:
1. How to identify when patterns across modalities are "the same"?
2. How to represent cross-modal patterns?
3. How to discover new modalities of representation?

### 3. Concept Evolution Trees

Instead of just evolving individual heuristics, evolve entire conceptual frameworks:

```
ConceptTree: Mathematical Sequences
├── Simple Sequences
│   ├── Arithmetic
│   ├── Geometric
│   └── Discovered: Alternating
├── Composite Sequences
│   ├── Polynomial Growth
│   ├── Discovered: Multi-Modal
│   └── Discovered: Meta-Patterns
└── Meta-Concepts
    ├── Pattern Families
    ├── Evolution Rules
    └── Discovered: ???
```

Research questions:
1. How do we represent concept evolution?
2. How do we measure conceptual "fitness"?
3. How do we explore the space of possible concepts?

### 4. Self-Modifying Pattern Languages

Current pattern detectors are written in fixed Python code. What if the system could develop its own pattern description language?

Example evolution:
```python
# Stage 1: Basic patterns
pattern1 = "all(n % 2 == 0 for n in numbers)"

# Stage 2: Pattern composition
pattern2 = "AND(even(n), increasing(n))"

# Stage 3: Higher-order patterns
pattern3 = "EXISTS(p1, p2 IN patterns: COMPOSE(p1, p2) EXPLAINS data)"

# Stage 4: Self-modifying pattern language
new_pattern_construct = system.discover_pattern_primitive(
    observations=pattern_usage_data,
    current_limitations=known_gaps
)
```

Research challenges:
1. How to ensure safety in self-modifying code?
2. How to maintain interpretability?
3. How to evaluate novel pattern constructs?

### 5. Eurisko-GPT Integration

Instead of using LLMs just for code analysis, what if we created a specialized LLM trained on:
- Pattern discovery episodes
- Concept formation history
- Failed exploration attempts
- Successful compositions

This could lead to a system that combines:
- Symbolic pattern matching
- Neural concept formation
- Probabilistic exploration
- Logical verification

```python
class EuriskoGPT:
    def __init__(self):
        self.symbolic_engine = NeoEurisko()
        self.neural_engine = CustomLLM(
            training_data="eurisko_episodes.jsonl",
            architecture="pattern_specialized"
        )
        self.verification_engine = LogicalVerifier()
        
    def discover_patterns(self, data):
        # Neural suggestion of patterns
        candidates = self.neural_engine.suggest_patterns(data)
        
        # Symbolic verification
        verified = self.symbolic_engine.verify_patterns(candidates)
        
        # Logical proof attempts
        proofs = self.verification_engine.prove_patterns(verified)
        
        return self.compose_results(verified, proofs)
```

### 6. Meta-Learning Pattern Discovery

Current pattern detectors are hand-coded. What if the system could learn to discover new types of patterns?

Example:
```python
class PatternDiscoveryLearner:
    def observe_human_discoveries(self, episodes):
        """Learn from human pattern discovery episodes"""
        pass
        
    def propose_pattern_type(self, data):
        """Propose new types of patterns to look for"""
        pass
        
    def verify_discovery(self, pattern):
        """Verify that discovered pattern is genuine"""
        pass
```

Research questions:
1. How do we represent the space of possible pattern types?
2. How do we measure the "interestingness" of a new pattern type?
3. How do we validate pattern discovery strategies?

## Big Picture Questions

1. **Genuine Discovery**
   - How do we know when the system has discovered something truly new?
   - What's the difference between recombination and genuine discovery?
   - How do we measure conceptual novelty?

2. **Compositional Understanding**
   - How do we represent relationships between concepts?
   - How do we discover new ways to compose concepts?
   - How do we validate compositional discoveries?

3. **Learning to Learn**
   - Can the system discover new ways to discover?
   - How do we represent meta-learning in pattern discovery?
   - How do we evaluate meta-learning success?

## Next Steps

   - Build concept evolution framework
   - Create evaluation metrics

3. **Long Term**

The ultimate goal is to move from a system that finds pre-defined patterns to one that genuinely discovers new concepts, patterns, and ways of thinking.
