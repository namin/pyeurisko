# Working Fix Changes

## Changes Made

1. Removed record functions that always returned True
2. Made `if_working_on_task` checks strict
3. Added validation stages for specialization attempts

## Success Rates Match LISP

H5 & H6 show 0% success with 100% relevance, matching LISP's design:

```lisp
# H6 LISP stats
then-compute-failed-record (24908 . 56)  # Many failures
then-compute-record (58183 . 73)         # Some successes
```

Interpretation: Both should fail often but be potentially applicable (relevant) to many tasks.

## Next Port: H4

Looking at LISP stats:
```lisp
then-add-to-agenda-record (30653 . 87)  # ~35% success
then-print-to-user-record (18543 . 87)  # ~21% success
overall-record (68827 . 72)             # Mixed success rate
```

H4 would be good to port next since it shows varied success rates. It:
1. Triggers on new unit creation
2. Adds empirical data gathering tasks
3. Has documented success/failure patterns
