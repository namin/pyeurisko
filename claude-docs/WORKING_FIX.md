# Current Status of Heuristics Debugging

## Enabled Heuristics (h4, h5, h6)
Currently only h4, h5, and h6 are enabled in the system. These heuristics handle:

- h4: Gathers empirical data about newly synthesized units
- h5: Chooses slots for specialization when none specified 
- h6: Performs the actual specialization on chosen slots

## Current Issues

The main issue is that the heuristics are being marked as 100% relevant but 0% successful. Investigation revealed:

1. Relevance checking is too permissive:
   - Heuristics are being triggered for wrong task types
   - Added explicit task type checks in if_potentially_relevant 

2. Success tracking needs proper task completion:
   - Added task_results['success'] = True
   - Added task_results['status'] = 'completed'

## Debugging Strategy

1. Fix relevance checking:
   - Added explicit task type checks in if_potentially_relevant
   - h4: Only relevant for 'specialization' and 'define_concept'  
   - h5: Only relevant for 'specialization' without chosen slots
   - h6: Only relevant for 'specialization' with chosen slots

2. Proper task completion:
   - Each heuristic needs to set both success and status in task_results
   - Task manager looks for these flags to track success

3. Logging enhancements:
   - Added detailed debug logging for tracking:
     - Task types and processing
     - Slot selection and modification 
     - Unit creation and updates

## Next Steps

1. Complete implementation of proper task completion monitoring
2. Test each heuristic individually with controlled tasks
3. Verify task flow between heuristics:
   - h5 choosing slots
   - h6 specializing chosen slots
   - h4 gathering data about new units

## Special Considerations

The enabled heuristics form a chain:
1. h5 initiates specialization by choosing slots
2. h6 performs the specialization on those slots
3. h4 gathers data about resulting new units

This chain requires careful coordination of task types and supplemental data between heuristics.
