Here is my analysis of next steps for PyEurisko:

The fundamental issue we need to address is that PyEurisko's heuristics are not generating self-sustaining activity through new unit creation and task chaining. Based on my debugging, there are several key areas that require attention.

First, we need to ensure proper task handling and state management. The task results need to properly track new units and state changes. The current implementation loses track of units created during task execution, which prevents heuristics from examining and building upon new concepts. We should enhance the TaskManager to maintain a persistent record of new units across task lifecycles.

Second, we must implement proper heuristic record tracking. The core functionality of eurisclo depends on heuristics learning from their previous executions through record properties. Rather than using simple tuples, we should implement a full record tracking system that maintains statistics about heuristic performance and influences future decision making.

Third, the task generation system needs enhancement. Currently, even when heuristics successfully execute, they fail to generate new tasks that would drive further exploration. This breaks the core cycle of Eurisko where completed tasks spawn new investigations. We need to implement proper task generation in the 'then_add_to_agenda' functions and ensure new tasks receive appropriate priorities.

Fourth, we must recreate eurisclo's "generalizations" functionality. Key heuristics depend on being able to generalize concepts by examining related units. The current implementation lacks this capability, which prevents many of the more sophisticated heuristics from functioning. We should implement generalization logic in the Unit class and integrate it with the heuristic framework.

Finally, we need better introspection capabilities. Eurisko's power comes from its ability to examine and modify its own concepts. Our current implementation has limited self-modification abilities. We should enhance the Unit and TaskManager classes to support richer introspection and self-modification.

I recommend tackling these improvements in this order, as each builds upon the previous one. The first priority should be fixing task state management, as this will unblock progress on the other areas.

I have written detailed notes on the implementation of each step in the codebase. The key files to modify are:
- tasks/__init__.py for task handling
- units.py for generalization support
- heuristics/__init__.py for record tracking

Success will be measured by seeing heuristics generate new units and tasks in a self-sustaining way, similar to the original Eurisko system.
