# Run

With execute_command, use a `workdir` with the current directory.

- `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
  Install the package (only once).
- `python -m eurisko.main -v 2 -n 10`
  Run the program (whenever), `-v 2` if for verbose debugging, `-n 10` is to limit the number of tasks processed per cycle.
  
Then browse the files in `my-notes` and `claude-docs`, and propose some next steps.
